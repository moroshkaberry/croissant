    <h1>Hello, Croissant lovers!</h1>
    <p>
      A symbol of the French breakfast, the croissant actually comes from
      Austria, probably originating in the 13th Century. The main ingredient in
      this soft pastry is unsalted butter, which is spread on the dough before
      baking. This is what gives the croissant its flaky, buttery flavor.
