      About 1,620,000 results (0.40 seconds) A symbol of the French breakfast,
      the croissant actually comes from Austria, probably originating in the
      13th Century. The main ingredient in this soft pastry is unsalted butter,
      which is spread on the dough before baking. This is what gives the
      croissant its flaky, buttery flavor.
